# **App Name**: WOD Calendar

## Core Features:

- WOD Display: Display the Workout of the Day (WOD) for each date, fetched from the internal content. Include links to referenced videos and movement descriptions, and organize all content in line with all users/movement level RX/Elite/Intermediate guidelines.
- Calendar View: Show a calendar interface allowing users to easily navigate and view WODs by date. All WODs in the input are to be loaded in to the interface. Assume every month of 2025 contains WODs.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the calendar and WOD information are displayed correctly on different screen sizes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light teal (#90EE90) to evoke a sense of calm and focus, reminiscent of a clear morning workout session.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F0F0F0) to maintain a clean, minimal aesthetic.
- Accent color: Soft light blue (#ADD8E6) for interactive elements to highlight without being intrusive.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a modern and clean sans-serif, should be used for both body text and headings to ensure readability and maintain a minimalist style.
- Use simple, line-based icons to represent different workout types or categories. These should be monochromatic and align with the overall minimalist aesthetic.
- The layout should be clean and well-organized, using a grid system to ensure consistency and readability. Ample white space should be used to avoid clutter.
- Subtle transitions and animations can be used to enhance the user experience, such as fade-in effects when loading WODs or smooth scrolling between dates.
